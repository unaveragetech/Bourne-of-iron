Graf Albrecht von Hohenzollern stared down at the wailing infant in his arms, her cry echoing off stone walls streaked by torchlight. The air in the birthing chamber tasted of blood and smoldering iron, each breath a caustic reminder of the unnatural here. Iron braziers—a ring of them—lined the walls, their coals pulsing like dying stars whenever the child’s shriek pierced the gloom.

“Give her to me,” whispered the midwife, her slender hands still slick with birth’s remnants. She stepped forward, ring of cold iron on her finger, and brushed the band gently against the baby’s cheek. In an instant, that ring twisted, jaws of living metal snapping closed. Bone cracked. The midwife’s scream was choked off as her other rings sprouted like terrible barbs, cutting her mid-sentence, embedding themselves in her throat. Blood sprayed the tapestries in rivulets, the pattern of royal griffins now lost in a crimson tide.

Ser Dietrich of the Magnetic Rose lurched for his sword—but steel rebelled. The moment his gauntlet clasped the hilt, the blade fused to its sheath, the pommel melting into a molten pool that dripped burning metal onto his thigh. He hefted his gauntlet in panic; the iron softened wherever the infant’s gaze fell, as if her tiny stare held molten power. With a prayer to every saint, he tore the gauntlet free, shards embedding in his forearm.

“By all the saints,” he gasped, blood and sweat mingling at his brow. “This is no child. This is a weapon waiting to be loaded.” He backed toward the door, armor plates clattering, but before he could reach the threshold, the castle itself seemed to rebel. The ancient stained‑glass windows exploded inward, showering fractured cobalt and crimson across the nursery. Shards spun in turbulent eddies of air, embedding themselves in wall hangings—and in flesh. A young servant boy crumpled, a sliver of Saint Michael’s sword pinning him through the eye.

Graf Albrecht pressed the babe closer, his ceremonial breastplate groaning in protest. He tasted copper on his tongue where the metal groaned against his teeth. “She’s only frightened,” he lied, voice shaking as the castle trembled. “Newborns cry.”

Ser Dietrich’s voice was gone, replaced by a ragged whisper. “That’s no crying. That’s a storm given flesh.” He lifted his ruined gauntlet, the iron claws fused with his hand. “The Brotherhood will hear of this. They’ll come with lead‑lined chains and—”

A great chandelier of wrought iron plummeted between them, candles igniting rushes and drapes in a sudden inferno. The knight didn’t hesitate. He bolted for the door, armor glowing red‑hot at each seam, and vanished into the corridor’s smoke.

Alone, Albrecht sank to his knees beside a cradle that would never cradle anything—its iron frame warped, coils writhing like snakes. The infant’s tiny hand closed around his signet ring. The Hohenzollern eagle, once proud and majestic, melted under her touch, talons curving into something grotesque and clawed.

“Valeska,” he murmured, naming her for the iron‑witch of legend. The word felt foreign on his tongue, but somehow right. Outside, the winter wind rattled the castle’s foundations as though whispering to the stone, secrets too ancient to understand.

Below, in a long‑forgotten smithy sealed behind rusted doors, an anvil began to vibrate. No servant dared descend there. But tonight, something deep in the earth had heard Valeska’s first breath—and it answered.

Weeks later, Albrecht stood before a long oaken table in his private study, the infant asleep in a cradle behind him. Scattered across the tabletop lay fragments of iron—the midwife’s broken rings, the shattered chandelier candleholder, the twisted breastplate. He reached out, invited by the metal’s subtle hum, and watched rivulets of crimson light seep into his fingers. Here, he would begin his experiments. Carefully. Patiently. He would unlock the secret of iron’s sentience—and of his daughter’s power—before the Brotherhood’s scouts even dared knock on the gates of Königsberg Castle
